### Get started

You will have to download a program called "Mu". It's a python program that let's you flash your sensor.
Then in the folder source_code there will be 3 files. You need to choose one of your sensors to be a "reciever".
Flash the reciever.py file unto the "reciever sensor" and have it plugged into a PC all the time.
For the rest of the sensors you can flash the send_data.py file to them but change the id for each sensors in the code using Mu.
You can now start the send_data_to_database.py file in a terminal on the same PC that you have the "receiver" connected to.
